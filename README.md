# Real Housewives of Lagos (RHOL) Analysis
In this project, I used Natural Language Processing (NLP) to scrape and analyze tweets about the Real Housewives of Lagos reality TV show's second season. The aim was to gain insights into viewers' perceptions about the show. My Jupyter notebook [here](https://ogeano.github.io/Real-Housewives-Of-Lagos-Analysis/) contains all the Python code I wrote to carry out this project. 
I also documented the whole process in an article published in the Medium publication Level Up Coding. You can read my article [here](https://medium.com/gitconnected/the-real-housewives-of-lagos-rhol-a-tweet-scraping-and-nlp-project-094e91d569b6) to get some insights into my thought process.
